Our product vendors are ready to start selling and shipping their products to customers.
However, lacking software expertise they rely on us to build them an online store.
so they can reach a large number of internet customers worldwide.
You need to build the entire backend which will integrate with the front-end, 
as well as the database, and power the entire shopping experience

Our frontend developer has already prepared the home page and checkout page for you (HTML, CSS, and Javascript),
and the database engineer prepared a few Java classes to assist you in integrating with our SQL database.

When a user goes to our store's homepage, they will be presented with a list of buttons representing all
the available product categories in the store. When a user clicks on a product category, all the products
that match that category will show up on the screen. In addition, there will be a deals button which will
present the user with the deals of the days and an all button which will show the user all the products
available in our store.

The user will be able to add any number of items of each product to their cart.

Once the user clicks on the checkout button, they will be able to complete their purchase by providing
their contact and payment information on the checkout page.

To achieve the above functionality you will implement a REST API and as well as all the necessary business logic.
